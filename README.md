# Hi, I'm Arnav 👋
**Computer Science @ University of St Andrews**

I use nvim and arch btw.

## 🚀 What I Do
I like building things. My projects span from **multi-threaded Rust servers** to **genetic algorithms** to **mobile apps** and **web apps**. 

**TLDR;**
- 🦀 **Crustacean** - Building blazingly fast applications with Rust 
- 🧠 **Unorthodox Optimizations** - Genetic algorithms and Simulated Annealing. Originally Fascinated by the [Slime Mould Experiment](https://www.wired.com/2010/01/slime-mold-grows-network-just-like-tokyo-rail-system/)   
- 📱 **Full-stack development** - Flutter, React, Rust Backends, DevOps and Scripting.
- 🎯 **Real-world problem solving** - Like predicting gym occupancy so you don't walk into a packed space.
- **JavaScript Hater ❌, TypeScript Enjoyer ✅** - I like Types.
- ⛓ **Into Constraints Programming** - Don't abbreviate that please. 
- 🔥 **I use arch and nvim btw** - 😎

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### [Constraints](https://github.com/Arnav-Bista/constraints) - NP-Hard Problem Solver
- **Genetic Algorithm + Simulated Annealing** implementation in Rust
- Solves **Travelling Salesman Problem** with interactive GUI
- **WASM compilation** for web integration (expanding to NextJS)
- **Extensible framework** - can model any optimization problem
- *Evolution: Started in Julia → Java → Rust*

### My Occupancy - Gym Crowd Predictor
- **Multi-threaded Rust backend** with custom web scraper using Tokio runtime
- **Flutter frontend** for mobile app
- **ML prediction system** combining KNN + Gradient Boosting
- **Real problem solved**: No more walking into packed gyms
- [Backend](https://github.com/Arnav-Bista/occupancy-backend), [Frontend](https://github.com/Arnav-Bista/occupancy-frontend)
- *Tech: Rust, Flutter, Tokio, Hyper, ML*
